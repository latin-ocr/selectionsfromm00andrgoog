Puanrus Ovrnrtrs Naso, one ol the most celebrated Latin poeta os tha
Augustan age, was born at Sulmo, a town os the Peligni, in the forty-third
year before the Christian era. He was os an equestrian family, and iu his
youth applied himself to the study os the law; but aster practising sora
short time in the forum, he devoted himself with great ardor to literary pur·
suits, to which bis genius had always inclined him He soon became dia·
tiuguished as a poet, and sor many years continued to enjoy a high reputa·
tion at the court ot‘ Augustus. At length, at the age os liity years, he had
the missortune, sor some cause now unknown, to ollend the emperor, and
was banished by him to Tomi, a town near the Black Sea, where he died
about eight years aller.

Ovid wasone of tha most voluminous poeta ol hisege,and alargapor·
tion ol his waitings still remains. 01* all his poams tha Metamorphoses are
probably the most usesul, and the best known. Tbese were composed be·
sore his banishment, and had not, at the time ot* that event, received their
final polish srom his hand. On this account, before leaving Italy, ho at·
tempted to suppress them; but copies had been so extensively circulated,
that he was unable to accomplish his purpose. This work comprises most
ol* the mythological sables os the Greeks and Romans, united in aucha
manner as to sorrn a regular and connected series.

The Heroides were a happy invention ot‘ Ovid, affording him a favorable
opportunity to exhibit his knowledge ct‘ ancient customs and manners, and
his acquaintance with the human heart. They consist, sor the most part, ol*
letters seigned to have been written by tha most distinguished semalea os
antiquity to their husbands or others to whom they were attached.
