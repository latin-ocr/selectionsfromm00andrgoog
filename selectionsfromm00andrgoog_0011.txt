PREFACE.

Irr the series of elementary works published hythe editor
ol the present volume, on the basis of Andrewe aud Stoddards
Latin Grammar, the following Seleotions from the poenis ol'
Orid nre intended as an Introduction to Latin Poetry.

Experieneed tesohers hare osten regretted the enatum, so
prevalent in the sohools ol this oountry, ol passing abruptly
l'rom the easier prose writers to a work so diffioult, in many
respeots‚ as the AEneid of Virgil-a work requiring‚ sor its
prolitahle perusal, so intimate a knowledge ol the mythology.
and sabulone history of the Greeks, and ot‘ the peculiarities ol
poetic diction. In preparing this volume, the editor has en·
deavored to remedy‚ so far as was in his power, the evils arising
from this curtem, by surnishing a First Book in Latin Poetry
more simple in its style, and aooompanied with sneh helps as
might serve to render the transition from prose to poetry more
' easy, and consequently more agreeable. For such a purpose,
the better portione ol the writings ol Orid are peouliarly well
adapted, and to this use they have long been applied in the
olassieal sehools ol Europe. While the versification ol this
· authoris in no ordinary degree harmonious, his language is
simple, and his arrangement easy and natural. His subject,
also, in the works srom whioh the following extraots are taken,
is well fitted sor arr introduction to the study ol Latin poetry,
inasmuoh as the mythologioal sables os the Greeks are as
inseparably interworen with the Latin, as with the Greoian
poetry.
